# Use a dataset containing wine features to predict the quality of the wine.




In this project, I utilized the Wine Quality dataset to build a predictive model that estimates the quality of wine based on various features such as acidity, sugar content, and pH level. Here's a brief overview of the process:

Data Exploration: I started by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and features. This step involved checking for missing values, understanding the distribution of the target variable (wine quality), and visualizing key relationships between features.

Data Preprocessing: Next, I preprocessed the data by scaling numerical features using StandardScaler and splitting it into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model.

Model Selection and Training: For this project, I chose a Linear Regression model as it is well-suited for regression tasks. After training the model on the training data, I evaluated its performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.

Results and Insights: The trained model achieved a mean squared error of [insert MSE value] and an R-squared of [insert R-squared value], indicating [insert insights about model performance].

Overall, this project not only helped me sharpen my machine learning skills but also provided valuable insights into the factors that contribute to wine quality.

I'm looking forward to diving deeper into other machine learning projects and exploring new datasets. Feel free to connect with me to discuss this project or explore potential collaborations in the field of data science and machine learning!
